# Mastermind

Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game where one player (or the computer) creates a secret code, and the other player attempts to guess it within a limited number of attempts. This implementation, written entirely in Ruby, provides an interactive gameplay experience where players can challenge their logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Key features:

Customizable Code Length and Difficulty: Adjust the code length and range of colors/numbers for varied challenge levels.
Interactive Feedback: After each guess, the game provides hints about how many guesses are correct in both color and position.
Replayability: The game can be replayed with different secret codes, ensuring endless fun.
Put your code-breaking skills to the test and see how quickly you can crack the code!
